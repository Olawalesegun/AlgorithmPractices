const colors = "WWBWBBBW";
playGame(colors);

This code defines a playGame function that takes the initial string of colors as input and simulates the game according to the rules you've described. The game continues until a player can no longer make a move, at which point the game terminates and the losing player is announced.

Please note that this is a simplified version of the game rules you've described, and it assumes the input string is formatted correctly. You might need to add additional input validation if necessary.

Certainly! Here's the equivalent implementation in Java:

java

public class Game {
    public static boolean canRemoveAdjacent(String s, int index) {
        return s.charAt(index) == s.charAt(index - 1) && s.charAt(index) == s.charAt(index + 1);
    }

    public static void playGame(String colors) {
        String currentPlayer = "Wendy";

        while (true) {
            boolean canRemove = false;

            for (int i = 1; i < colors.length() - 1; i++) {
                if ((currentPlayer.equals("Wendy") && colors.charAt(i) == 'W' && canRemoveAdjacent(colors, i)) ||
                    (currentPlayer.equals("Bob") && colors.charAt(i) == 'B' && canRemoveAdjacent(colors, i))) {
                    StringBuilder updatedColors = new StringBuilder(colors);
                    updatedColors.deleteCharAt(i);
                    colors = updatedColors.toString();
                    canRemove = true;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (!canRemove) {
                System.out.println(currentPlayer + " has lost the game.");
                break;
            }

            currentPlayer = (currentPlayer.equals("Wendy")) ? "Bob" : "Wendy";
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String colors = "WWBWBBBW";
        playGame(colors);
    }
}

This Java code defines a Game class with methods for checking adjacent pieces and playing the game according to the provided rules. The main method demonstrates how to test the game with an example string of colors. Just like the JavaScript version, this Java implementation also assumes the input string is formatted correctly.


function gameWinner(colors) {
    let wendyTurn = true;

    while (true) {
        let canRemove = false;
        let updatedColors = "";

        for (let i = 1; i < colors.length - 1; i++) {
            let currentColor = colors[i];
            let prevColor = colors[i - 1];
            let nextColor = colors[i + 1];

            if ((wendyTurn && currentColor === 'W' && prevColor === 'W' && nextColor === 'W') ||
                (!wendyTurn && currentColor === 'B' && prevColor === 'B' && nextColor === 'B')) {
                canRemove = true;
            } else {
                updatedColors += currentColor;
            }
        }

        if (!canRemove) {
            console.log(wendyTurn ? "Bob has lost the game." : "Wendy has lost the game.");
            break;
        }

        wendyTurn = !wendyTurn;
        colors = updatedColors;
    }
}

// Test the game with an example string of colors
const colors = "WWBWBBBW";
playGame(colors);

In this JavaScript version, the playGame function handles both players' turns and the game logic within a single function. Similar to the previous implementations, the game continues alternating between Wendy and Bob until a player can no longer make a valid move. The updatedColors string is used to simulate the removal of pieces from the string. Just like before, this code assumes that the input string is formatted correctly.
